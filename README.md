# [Kata Seeds](http://kata-seeds.github.io): Java + Gradle

[![Build Status][travis-svg]][travis]

Based on [java-junit-seed](https://github.com/kata-seeds/java-junit-seed) but it
is using Gradle instead of Maven.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo with `git`:

    git clone https://github.com/kata-seeds/java-gradle-seed.git
    cd java-gradle-seed

Install dependencies and run your tests with `make`:

    make

You should eventually see 1 test ran and 0 failures. If `make` doesn't work for
you, please open an issue.

Now you can start your kata! May we suggest the [Game of Life][GoL]?
